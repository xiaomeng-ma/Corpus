*DEBR:	(..) &=in Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen 0_2180
	&=in We'd like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park 2180_4579
	and to the Hall of Champions presentation . 4579_6737
*DEBR:	&=in We have four geldings and one stallion that we'll present for you this afternoon 6737_10916
	&=in and as we bring them out 10916_12279
	we'll give you the history on each one 12279_13847
	and please feel free to take all the pictures that you want 13847_16381
	and to ask questions . 16381_17713
*DEBR:	(..) 17713_40750
	Our first horse here today at the Hall of Champions 40750_43295
	is our only thoroughbred stallion . 43295_45177
*DEBR:	(.) This is Bold Forbes . 45177_46673
*DEBR:	(.) &=in Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion 46673_49527
	and he was foaled in nineteen seventy-three . 49527_51798
*DEBR:	&=in He is by the stallion Irish Castle 51798_54198
	and out of the unraced mare Comely Nell . 54198_56370
*DEBR:	&=in He was bred by Lee Eaton 56370_58371
	and Red Bull Stables . 58371_59678
*DEBR:	&=in This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventy-four . 59678_64753
*DEBR:	(.) &=in Mister Estaban Tizol 64753_66742
	a banker and real estate developer from Puerto Rico 66742_69408
	&=in liked Bold Forbes' pedigree . 69408_71115
*DEBR:	And he liked this horse so much 71115_73005
	&=in that he decided he was going to buy him 73005_75154
	no matter what the cost . 75154_76520
*DEBR:	(.) &=in The cost ended up being fifteen-thousand two-hundred dollars 76520_80287
	&=in and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico . 80287_85185
*DEBR:	(..) &=in In Bold Forbes' very first start in Puerto Rico as a two-year-old 85185_89181
	&=in he went off at odds of thirty-five to one 89181_91734
	(.) and he won that race by seventeen lengths . 91734_94099
*DEBR:	(..) &=in He was entered into four more races 94099_96594
	(.) he won them all 96594_97500
	&=in and in doing so 97500_98735
	he was named champion two-year-old in Puerto Rico . 98735_101515
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico 101515_105545
	&=in so it didn't take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition . 105545_109205
*DEBR:	(..) &=in So in the summer of nineteen seventy-five 109205_111798
	he was shipped to New York 111798_113073
	to his new trainer Laz Barrera . 113073_115076
*DEBR:	(..) &=in In New York he won the Freemont Stakes 115076_117842
	and the Saratoga Special 117842_119150
	before he injured his shins 119150_120458
	and was given the rest of the year off . 120458_122312
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well all of Bold Forbes's races up to this point had been sprints 122312_126178
	or six furlong races . 126178_127828
*DEBR:	&=in The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race 127828_130682
	at a mile and a quarter . 130682_131815
*DEBR:	(..) So as a three-year-old 131815_133227
	Forbes wasn't given much of a chance at all in the Kentucky Derby . 133227_136557
*DEBR:	(..) &=in But his trainer had more confidence in him than that 136557_139828
	&=in and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle 139828_142359
	&=in Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby 142359_144604
	at odds of seventeen to one 144604_146401
	(..) one length in front of the leader 146401_148359
	(.) Honest Pleasure . 148359_149374
*DEBR:	(..) &=in The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes . 149374_152840
*DEBR:	He cut his left hind heel during the race 152840_154850
	but he still managed to run third . 154850_156638
*DEBR:	(..) &=in But when the Belmont rolled around 156638_158540
	he had that all healed up 158540_159787
	and he won the Belmont stakes by a neck . 159787_161868
*DEBR:	(..) &=in In October 161868_163180
	Forbes was entered into the Vosburgh Handicap 163180_165555
	and again he severely bruised his right hind foot . 165555_168206
*DEBR:	&=in Again he ran a very game third 168206_170490
	but after this race 170490_171533
	he was considered too valuable a breeding stallion to risk any more injury . 171533_175459
*DEBR:	&=in So he was retired to stud from the track . 175459_178011
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share 178011_183016
	&=in and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm . 183016_186771
*DEBR:	(..) &=in As a stallion 186771_188187
	Bold Forbes produced a champion filly Tiffany Lass 188187_190967
	a winner of over half a million dollars 190967_192824
	&=in Bold Apparel 192824_194046
	a champion filly in Italy 194046_195575
	&=in Air Forbes One 195575_196948
	and over two-hundred other winners . 196948_198773
*DEBR:	&=in (.) Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars 198773_202010
	in just two years on the racetrack . 202010_203806
*DEBR:	&=in He was in eighteen races 203806_205714
	and had thirteen wins 205714_207198
	and was never worse than third . 207198_208897
*DEBR:	(..) &=in He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninety-one . 208897_212825
*DEBR:	(.) &=in He is twenty-one years old 212825_214753
	and stands fifteen point three hands tall . 214753_217305

	I [% laugh] don't [% laugh] know [% laugh] if everyone can see him 237794_238923
	&=in ʔover here in this paddock on: the right 238923_241641
	&=in this is Sergeant Pepper Feature 241641_243519
	and 243519_243768
	he's usually in our show 243768_244968
	but 244968_245115
	because Bold Forbes is up here today 245115_246799
	he +/. 246799_247010
*DEBR:	We kicked him out . 247010_247728
*DEBR:	We have six horses that belong to the Hall of Champions 247728_250165
	&=in and only five stalls . 250165_251665
*DEBR:	So we could only have five at a time in the show . 251665_253637
*DEBR:	&=in &=lengthened Um 253637_254315
	Sergeant Pepper was the nineteen eighty-two world champion racing quarter horse 254315_258314
	&=in and 258314_258957
	at the time of his retirement 258957_260368
	he was the eighth richest quarter horse in history 260368_262880
	&=in and he had earnings of over nine-hundred thousand dollars . 262880_265843
*DEBR:	(..) So 265843_266456
	on your way out (.) today 266456_267708
	you might wanna just take a look over there 267708_269223
	and say hi to Sergeant Pepper . 269223_270449
*DEBR:	(..) 270449_295850
	And there's Bold Forbes looking out the window . 295850_297809
*DEBR:	&{l=@ If anybody can see him 297809_299021
	he's right there 299021_299715
	&=in watching the show &}l=@ . 299715_301073
*DEBR:	(..) 301073_315574
	&=in Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions 315574_319796
	that is not a racehorse . 319796_321132
*DEBR:	(..) This is Imperator . 321132_322718
*DEBR:	And he is a five-gaited American Saddlebred showhorse . 322718_326015
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Perry 326015_327022
	as he is commonly called 327022_328242
	is by the sire Supreme Sultan 328242_330177
	who is buried in front of the saddlehorse museum here at the Horse Park . 330177_333322
*DEBR:	(.) &=in He is out of the dam Empress Wing 333322_335612
	(.) and she is by the great sire Wing Commander . 335612_338172
*DEBR:	&=in Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator . 338172_342485
*DEBR:	(.) &=in Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois 342485_345294
	&=in and he was purchased there as a two-year-old 345294_347450
	by his owner 347450_348141
	Doctor Geraldine Meanor 348141_349520
	&=in and then sent to his trainer 349520_351118
	Don Harris 351118_351838
	of Simpsonville Kentucky . 351838_353182
*DEBR:	(.) &=in Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared . 353182_357305
*DEBR:	&=in They both had the same birthday . 357305_359450
*DEBR:	&=in And as the years went past 359450_361123
	and Imperator's popularity increased 361123_363219
	&=in Mister Harris didn't get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did . 363219_368766
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Being five-gaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits 368766_373364
	(.) the walk trot and canter 373364_374888
	&=in plus two manmade gaits 374888_376546
	the slow gait and the rack . 376546_377876
*DEBR:	(..) &=in The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which they're performed . 377876_381673
*DEBR:	(..) Perry's greatest accomplishment was winning the five-gaited world grand championship four times . 381673_387082
*DEBR:	&=in And he has also been reserve world champion five times . 387082_390354
*DEBR:	(..) &=in He was shown eighty-five times 390354_392290
	at forty-four shows around the country . 392290_394167
*DEBR:	&=in He has sixty-eight blue ribbons 394167_396137
	thirteen seconds 396137_397185
	and very rarely was he ever worse than third . 397185_399854
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Now the first time Perry was shown 399854_402183
	he was very wild and inexperienced 402183_404396
	and he stepped on just about every foot in the show ring . 404396_407354
*DEBR:	&=in And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions . 407354_411005
*DEBR:	(..) &=in But the second time he was shown 411005_413226
	he had improved so much 413226_414608
	&=in the judges said he would have won if he'd been lying on his back 414608_417955
	(.) with all four feet stuck up in the air . 417955_419950
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Perry's most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail . 419950_424623
*DEBR:	(.) &=in At the highlight of his career 424623_426608
	&=in (.) Perry's tail was fourteen feet long 426608_428924
	and could be wrapped completely around his body . 428924_431146
*DEBR:	(..) If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry 431146_434076
	&=in you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail . 434076_437052
*DEBR:	(.) &=in When Perry was retired 437052_438657
	Mister Harris cut his tail 438657_440152
	to make it easier to care for 440152_441768
	&=in and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from Perry's tail . 441768_446670
*DEBR:	(.) &=in Well Perry had been retired here for about two years 446670_450175
	&=in but had never had a formal retirement . 450175_452513
*DEBR:	&=in So in August of nineteen ninety-one 452513_454965
	Perry was formally retired at the world championship horse show in Louisville Kentucky . 454965_459208
*DEBR:	(.) &=in That night 459208_460484
	Imperator and his trainer 460484_461905
	Mister Don Harris 461905_463005
	&=in stepped into the ring 463005_464295
	one last time together 464295_465577
	&=in and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteen-eighties . 465577_470450
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Perry is now twenty years old 470450_472635
	and stands fifteen point three hands tall . 472635_475000
*DEBR:	&=in Ladies and gentlemen 475000_476385

*DEBR:	Yes . 487947_488401
*AUD:	(..) What's the average age that a horse lives to . 488401_492198
*DEBR:	&=in A good average is about twenty-eight 492198_494398
	if they're well taken care of . 494398_495988
*DEBR:	Um 495988_496336
	a lotta horses will live into their thirties . 496336_498617
*DEBR:	(..) &=in A- a good way to compare horse ages to humans 498617_501865
	is to multiply by three . 501865_503429
*DEBR:	(..) And +/. 503429_504690

*DEBR:	(..) He was bred and raised at Claiborne Farm in Paris Kentucky . 589088_592660
*DEBR:	(.) &=in Due to Forego's large size 592660_594801
	he was not raced as a two-year-old 594801_596534

*DEBR:	(..) &=in He started his racing career as a three-year-old . 599662_602485
*DEBR:	And he ran well enough to be entered in the nineteen seventy-three Kentucky Derby . 602485_606518
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby 606518_611542

*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well Forego wasn't as successful as Secretariat that day 613605_617291

*DEBR:	(..) This is John Henry . 858530_860335
*DEBR:	(..) &=in John Henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings . 860335_864454
*DEBR:	&=in He is by the stallion Old Bob Bowers 864454_867012

*DEBR:	(..) &=in John was born on March ninth nineteen seventy-five 876075_879775

*DEBR:	(.) &=in The farm kept John until nineteen seventy-six 882222_885332

*DEBR:	(..) &=in So because of his small size 896021_898298
	his lack of pedigree 898298_899522
	but most of all 899522_900382
	his very nasty disposition 900382_902161
	&=in John brought only eleven hundred dollars . 902161_904885
*DEBR:	(..) &=in And from the time of this first sale 904885_907220
	until May nineteen seventy-eight 907220_909048
	&=in John was sold 909048_910228

	Sam Rubin 918859_919612
	&=in decided it would be fun to own a racehorse . 919612_922034
*DEBR:	(.) &=in Well Mister Rubin didn't know anything about horses 922034_925096
	&=in and the only thing he knew about racing 925096_927174
	is where the valet parking was . 927174_928861
*DEBR:	(..) &=in So he bought John Henry 928861_930796
	over the telephone 930796_931837
	sight unseen 931837_932681

	but this time by fourteen lengths . 950238_952144
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than Mister Rubin did 952144_956616

	&=laugh &=laugh &=in &{l=@ and um 1146636_1147961
	&=in &}l=@ so Willie adopted it . 1147961_1149413
*DEBR:	&=laugh &=laugh 1149413_1149903
	And that (.) original goat died about a year ago 1149903_1151769
	and Willie was real sad and depressed 1151769_1153299
	so they got him a new one . 1153299_1154425
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Our last horse to come out today 1154425_1159690
	is our standardbred representative 1159690_1161583
	Rambling Willie . 1161583_1162538
*DEBR:	(.) &=in A standardbred races at a trot or a pace 1162538_1165598
	and they pull a sulky with a driver . 1165598_1167368
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Willie is a pacer . 1167368_1168820
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana 1168820_1171777
	and he began his racing career as a to-year-old 1171777_1174235
	for his owner Raymond Gibson . 1174235_1175830
*DEBR:	&=in He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds 1175830_1179257
	&=in so he did show some promise 1179257_1181152
	but Mister Gibson decided to sell Willie as a three-year-old . 1181152_1184290
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver 1184290_1187709
	Mister Robert Farrington 1187709_1189001
	for fifteen thousand dollars . 1189001_1190663
*DEBR:	&=in But not long after he bought him 1190663_1192489
	Mister Farrington decided he'd spent too much money on this horse 1192489_1195916
	&=in so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio 1195916_1198888
	Mister Paul Sebert 1198888_1200039
	&=in and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie . 1200039_1204062
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before 1204062_1206956
	&=in and his luck had been pretty bad . 1206956_1208791
*DEBR:	(.) &=in The first horse he owned died 1208791_1210656
	before it made it to the racetrack 1210656_1212179
	&=in and the second horse he owned made it to the races 1212179_1214790
	and she ran and ran 1214790_1215895
	but just couldn't win anything 1215895_1217389
	so he sold her . 1217389_1218305
*DEBR:	(.) &=in And after he sold her 1218305_1219737
	she went on to win her next four starts in a row for her new owner . 1219737_1223293
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though 1223293_1226950
	&=in and things didn't start off so well there either . 1226950_1229565
*DEBR:	(..) Willie was being raced at county fairs 1229565_1232044
	in Ohio and Indiana 1232044_1233422
	&=in and was being beaten on a regular basis . 1233422_1235950
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well around this time Mister Farrington's wife Vivian was having a birthday 1235950_1240796
	&=in and he was trying to decide what to get her . 1240796_1243074
*DEBR:	(.) &=in So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian 1243074_1246318
	would be the other half of Willie . 1246318_1248009
*DEBR:	(..) &=in Well Vivian was a very religious person 1248009_1251110
	&=in and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church . 1251110_1254627
*DEBR:	(.) &=in So Vivian decided 1254627_1256364
	that if Willie ever had any success at the racetrack 1256364_1259159
	&=in she would donate ten percent 1259159_1261170
	of her half of Willie's earnings 1261170_1262853
	to her father's church . 1262853_1264194
*DEBR:	(..) &=in And that's when Willie's racing career took off . 1264194_1267106
*MANY:	&=LAUGHTER . 1267106_1268069

	he had an autograph session at Macy's department store . 1282063_1284878
