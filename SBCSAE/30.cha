*DANN:	(..) Our mission is a goal or task which one is destined to accomplish . 58033_62095

	(..) and here's the +/. 67886_68324
*DANN:	here's the definition I came up with 68324_69894
	(..) you can write this down 70198_71370

*DANN:	Whatever . 100100_100499
*DANN:	&=in Uh 101310_101700
	what is our vision . 101700_102634
*DANN:	(..) As a church planter 105121_106300
	Pastor Queen came 106300_107465
	(..) &=tsk &=in (..) having grown up here 107918_112385

	(.) &=in God brought him back 115798_117310

*DANN:	&=in And through his own personal experience 122670_124975
	and through &=in (..) the Scripture 124975_128255
	(..) &=tsk and God gave him a vision 128375_130090
	(..) for a church that was committed to being a part of what God was doing 130600_134035
	&=in (..) a church that was 134170_137300
	(..) invested in building the Kingdom of God . 138075_140750
*DANN:	(..) By caring for people where their needs were 143465_146225
	(..) and by sharing the truth 146225_149755
	(..) of the Gospel of Jesus Christ . 150015_151980
*DANN:	(..) &=tsk (.) Our vision is 160720_162965
	(.) is a direction of involvement toward a final destination . 162965_166285
*DANN:	(..) When I started thinking about missions 172680_174820
	I (.) thought immediately of (..) the Blues Brothers . 174820_179445
*DANN:	(..) You know 179850_180160
	and Dan Ackroyd 180160_180920
	(..) comes out 180920_181350
	I forget what his character was 181350_182750
	but he says 182750_183580
	(.) &{l=Q we're on a mission from God &}l=Q . 183705_185385
*DANN:	(..) &{l=SM And that's what the church is about 187735_189230
	we're on a mission from God &}l=SM . 189230_190850
*DANN:	(..) &=in In fact 191250_192550
	let me clarify it a little more . 192550_194230
*DANN:	(..) The church has been given a mission 196040_198135
	(..) but our mission is not for us to go and decide what we're gonna do 198910_202850
	(..) &=in our mission is to participate in 202710_205550
	an to carry out (..) God's mission . 205550_207975
*DANN:	(.) Because you see Go:d 207975_209665
	(..) is on a mission . 209685_211190
*DANN:	(..) God's mission is to build His Kingdom . 215095_217395
*DANN:	&{l=MRC To build the Kingdom of God &}l=MRC . 217395_219695
*DANN:	(..) &=in To bring the world of lost people into a real and personal love &=in relationship 219720_225035
	(..) with him . 225085_225990
*DANN:	(..) Through faith 226705_227450
	in His Son 227450_227995
	Jesus Christ . 227995_228965
*DANN:	(..) You know what 232795_233305
	if our vision 233305_234465
	(..) does not include reaching lost people 234465_236800
	and caring for lost people 236800_238200
	&=in then it's not God's vision . 238200_239900
*DANN:	Because the Bible is very clear 239900_241600
	that Go:d ca:res about lost people . 241600_244200
*AUD:	Yes . 244245_244615
*DANN:	(..) God loves &=in (.) people who don't have it all together . 245440_249580
*AUD:	Yes . 249580_250225
*DANN:	(..) God loves people who are hurting . 250225_252580
*AUD:	Yes . 252580_253095
*DANN:	(..) God loves people who are suffering . 254160_256200
*DANN:	Who are seeking . 256200_257050
*DANN:	(..) And if our vision 259645_260750
	as Uptown Baptist Church 260750_261900
	doesn't include . 261900_262815
*DANN:	(.) In fact 262815_263500
	if our vision as individual (.) Christians 263500_265650
	with a relationship with Christ 265650_267000
	does not include 267000_268205
	&=in (..) reaching out 268205_270450
	and touching 270450_271240
	(..) the lives of lost hurting (.) dying people 271355_274235
	&=in &{l=MRC it's not a vision from God &}l=MRC . 274275_276620
*DANN:	(..) &=in Because God's plan 284535_286415
	(.) is 286415_287125
	(.) and has always been 287125_288250
	to use (.) his people 288250_289580
	(.) &=in to carry out His mission . 289580_291590
*DANN:	(..) And we're gonna see that 292210_293350
	as we look at Moses . 293350_294880
*DANN:	(..) &=tsk &=in Beginning in the first chapter of Moses . 295130_297850
*DANN:	I'm not gonna read +/. 297850_298955
*DANN:	(..) I am gonna read some of it 299385_300570
	but I'm not gonna read all the way through 300570_302160
	(..) because we're gonna try to 302160_303355
	(.) breeze through the first four chapters . 303355_305140
*DANN:	(..) &=in Let's look how God was involved in Moses . 305690_308495
*DANN:	(..) Or how God involved Moses in His mission . 308495_311365
*DANN:	(..) Gary 317055_317550

	Moses was not only preserved 355195_357290
