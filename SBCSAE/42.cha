@Comment:	Stay out of It
@Comment:	Family argument and task-related talk, recorded in Pasco,
	Washington. The recording begins in a car, and moves to the kitchen
	of a family home. Main participants are three teenage sisters
	(Sabrina, Kendra, and Marlena), their mother (Kitty), and
	step-father (Curt). A friend of Sabrina's (Gemini) is also present.
	The dispute centers around Kitty's belief that Kendra stayed the
	night at a friend's house without permission, something which Kendra
	denies having done. Argument and shouting is interspersed with
	Saturday-morning housekeeping chores such as doing dishes and
	laundry.
