*PHIL:	&=in By now I'm sure you're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here 7590_10790
	but first 10790_11400
	&=in (..) I would like to (.) talk to you about these three items . 11720_14250
*PHIL:	I have here 14250_14970

	(.) and steam rising from this pot . 17490_19100
*PHIL:	&=in (.) Now: . 19100_20200
*PHIL:	(..) I would like to ask you 20410_21580

*PHIL:	(.) Tell me please . 22870_23740
*PHIL:	&=in How are they all alike . 23740_24850
*PHIL:	(..) &=in These three things . 26150_26920
*PHIL:	This ice here in this pan . 26920_28100
*PHIL:	&=in This water in this glass 28100_29190
	and the steam rising from this pot 29190_30240
	just yell it out 30240_30910
	w:e are informal here 30910_32020
	yes . 32020_32450
*PHIL:	&=in (.) Correct . 32450_33540
*PHIL:	(..) They are all forms of water . 33540_35170
*PHIL:	This ice here of course is water 35170_36600
	&=in I told you there was water in this glass 36600_38550
	(.) and you have all seen water boil at home 38550_40260
	so you are familiar with steam . 40260_41650
*PHIL:	&=in But now let's try to figure out how they're different 41650_43710
	we'll look at temperature 43710_44730
	&=in first . 44730_45370
*PHIL:	And the temperature o:f this water here 45370_46990

*PHIL:	(..) Yeah 61290_61630
	it's about a hundred a:nd eleven degrees . 61630_63580
*PHIL:	(..) Okay . 63640_64140

*PHIL:	&=in Oh 66820_67100
	and by the way guys 67100_67790
	what do we call something that's hard 67790_68870

*PHIL:	&=in We call it a ? 70870_71970

*PHIL:	(..) &=in Alright 844800_845460
	I'm pouring the very cold liquid nitrogen over this balloon . 845460_848200
*PHIL:	(.) &=in So the balloon and its contents 848200_849980
	the air insi:de 849980_850840
	is getting colder and colder and colder . 850840_852800
*PHIL:	&=in Okay those molecules are slowing down . 852800_854810
*PHIL:	They're going slower and slower 854810_855850
	&=in and so they're getting closer and closer together . 855850_858030
*PHIL:	Okay ? 858030_858430
*PHIL:	&=in You still have the same num:ber of air molecules inside this balloon 858430_861810
	&=in as you did before . 861810_863140
*PHIL:	(.) &=in It's just that 863140_864140
	&=in they're going slower 864140_865130
	so they're closer together 865130_866100
	and they take up less space 866100_867390
	&=in in this &=in balloon . 867390_869260
*PHIL:	(..) And look (.) at the balloon . 870530_872510
*PHIL:	&=in At the very bottom of it . 872510_873780
*PHIL:	You can see a liquid . 873780_874870
*PHIL:	(.) &=in That's the air people . 874870_876270
*PHIL:	How often do you get to see liquified air 876270_878150

*PHIL:	&=in (.) The molecules have gotten so: (.) slowed down 879200_882520
	and so close together that 882520_883690
	&=in they're less 883690_884430

*PHIL:	&=in But now . 889110_889900
*PHIL:	(.) The air around it 889900_890710

	&=in Ha ha: . 893690_894600
*PHIL:	(.) &=in And so 894600_895520
	(..) the molecules are speeding up 895520_897120
	they're getting further and further apart 897120_898580
	&=in (.) and taking up more space inside the balloon 898580_900760
	so the balloon goes back to its former size and shape . 900760_903260
*PHIL:	&=in So that has to be what's happening &=in to the balloons 903260_905960
	that are inside this container here . 905960_907690
*PHIL:	&=in Alright ? 907810_909000
*PHIL:	(..) &=SWALLOW Yes 909000_910250
	these balloons are in the very cold liquid nitrogen 910250_912260

	&=ex &=in the air 915870_917020
