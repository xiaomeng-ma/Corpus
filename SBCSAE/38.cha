@Comment:	Good Strong Dam
@Comment:	This segment is part of a tour of Hoover Dam, on the
	Nevada-Arizona border. The presentation is highly practiced. The
	main speaker also answers audience questions.
*BEN:	(.) Okay folks 0_708
	we're coming to a short stairway 708_2142
	use the handrails 2142_2970
	and be careful please . 2970_4087
*ENV:	&=FOOTSTEPS_AND_AMBIENT_CROWD_NOISE . 4087_94800
*BEN:	Okay folks 94800_95277
	let's find out where we are . 95277_96340
*BEN:	(..) We got on the elevator right here 96340_98341
	(.) came down and stood on the balcony overlooking the power plant 98341_101019
	(..) &=in down that stairway 101019_102583
	out on the power plant ramp about that far 102583_104621
	&=in then right at that yellow line . 104621_106508
*BEN:	&=in And you're now standing over the second-largest water pipe in the world 106508_110367
	&=in and it's called a penstock . 110367_112169
*BEN:	(..) More about that a little bit later . 112169_113829
*BEN:	(.) &=in The Colorado River 113829_115576
	flows in this direction . 115576_116871
*BEN:	&=in In order to build a dam here 116871_118334
	the very first thing they had to do: 118334_119995
	&=in was to get rid of that river . 119995_121498
*BEN:	(.) &=in So they came up here above where the dam was to be built 121498_124062
	&=in and drilled and blasted out 124062_125615
	four diversion tunnels . 125615_127057
*BEN:	&=in Two on either si:de 127057_128712
	&=in into the canyon wall 128712_130008
	around where the dam was to be built 130008_131566
	&=in out in the river down below . 131566_133106
*BEN:	&=in Each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at fifty-six feet in diameter 133106_137059
	&=in and then lined with three feet of concrete . 137059_139037
*BEN:	(.) &=in You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels . 139037_141740
*BEN:	(..) &=in They then came up here 141740_143063
	and they built a cofferdam about a hundred feet high 143063_145367
	&=in to force this river into these diversion tunnels . 145367_148081
*BEN:	&=in Came back down here 148081_149225
	built the other part of that cofferda:m 149225_150932
	&=in about sixty-five feet high: 150932_152823
	&=in to keep this water from backing into the work area . 152823_155578
*BEN:	&=in They now had from he:re 155578_157284
	&=in to here where they could build a dam . 157284_159045
*BEN:	(.) &=in They pumped the water out of this area 159045_161085
	&=in and excavated down another hundred and thirty-five feet to bedrock . 161085_164614
*BEN:	(.) &=in Okay folks 164614_165550
	if you will please 165550_166210
	take a look at this picture taken during construction 166210_168142
	(.) &=in looks like a series of boxes or blocks 168142_170764
	stacked one on top of the other 170764_172160
	(.) &=in and those are wooden concrete fo:rms . 172160_174694
*BEN:	&=in Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high 174694_177381
	&=in but they did vary in area somewhat 177381_179659
	&=in because they did not build the dam right straight across the river 179659_182756
	&=in from canyon wall to canyon wa:ll 182756_184641
	&=in they built it in the form of an arc . 184641_186624
*BEN:	(..) And it's called an arch (.) gravity design dam . 186624_189457
*BEN:	&=in Where the force of the water 189457_190965
	coming down the Colorado River hits the face of the dam 190965_193414
	&=in and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wa:ll . 193414_197085
*BEN:	(.) &=in It's a very strong design . 197085_199179
*BEN:	(..) They did build two concrete mixing plants here 199179_202265
	&=in they did pour concrete for twenty-four hours a day 202265_204764
	seven days a week 204764_205808
	&=in three hundred and sixty-five days a year . 205808_208020
*BEN:	&=in For two years 208020_209282
	(.) less (..) six days . 209282_211010
*BEN:	&=in Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eight-cubic-yard bucketloads . 211010_215743
*BEN:	&=in Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms 215743_218384
	&=in the smallest of which is twenty-two by twenty-five feet 218384_221163
	&=in only filled that form up about three or four inches deep . 221163_224279
*BEN:	(.) &=in So there goes that story you may have hea:rd 224279_226543
	&=in that there are workers buried in the concrete here . 226543_228852
*BEN:	(.) Couldn't possibly happen . 228852_230385
*BEN:	(.) &=in But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete 230385_233313
	&=in was one-inch steel water pipe . 233313_235110
*BEN:	(.) &=in They came down here in this lower cofferda:m 235110_237513
	&=in &=lengthened and they built an i:ce plant . 237513_239354
*BEN:	(.) Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day . 239354_242284
*BEN:	&=in They used that ice 242284_243653
	to chill the water 243653_244716
	&=in that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete . 244716_247705
*BEN:	(.) &=in As concrete ha:rdens 247705_249241
	or cures as we call it 249241_250501
	&=in it produces heat . 250501_251867
*BEN:	(..) The more you can control that heat 251867_254000
	&=in the better job of curing you're going to get . 254000_256033
*BEN:	(.) &=in So they used the chilled water method 256033_257910
	of taking that cold water 257910_259011
	&=in forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete 259011_261695
	&=in picking up some of that heat 261695_263338
	&=in then carrying that heat out and away . 263338_265191
*BEN:	(.) &=in They felt if they did not use a method such as this 265191_268036
	(.) that it would've taken approximately &=in one hundred and fifty years 268036_271600
	for the concrete (.) in the interior part of the dam &=in to cool down . 271600_274952
*BEN:	(.) &=in So the system did work . 274952_276454
*BEN:	(..) And then it hardened 276454_277555
	and they remove these wooden forms 277555_279138
	(.) &{l=X they &}l=X left voids . 279138_280185
*BEN:	Vertically and horizontally these forms came together 280185_282380
	&=in those voids were filled with grout . 282380_284248
*BEN:	Under high pressure . 284248_285215
*BEN:	(..) Grout being a mixture of concrete and water . 285215_287452
*BEN:	(..) &=in When this is done 287452_288601
	you have what we call a modified monolithic pour 288601_291376
	&=in or basically a solid block of concrete 291376_293568
	&=in which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base 293568_297237
	&=in fourty-five feet across the top 297237_299245
	&=in twelve hundred and fourty-four feet from wingtip to wingtip 299245_302187
	&=in seven hundred and twenty-six point four feet high . 302187_305229
*BEN:	(..) &{l=MRC Six point six million tons of concrete &}l=MRC . 305229_309063
*BEN:	(..) That's enough concrete to build a two-lane highway &=in from New York City to San Francisco . 309063_313871
*BEN:	(..) O:r 313871_314562
	put another way 314562_315313
	&=in a four-foot wide sidewalk from the North Pole to the South Pole . 315313_318459
*BEN:	(.) &=in Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit 318459_320785
	&=in the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways . 320785_323728
*BEN:	&=in As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon 323728_326260
	you may have noticed those spillways . 326260_327816
*BEN:	&=in Here they are 327816_328543
	one on either side . 328543_329686
*BEN:	(.) &=in What they did 329686_330808
	is they came in here 330808_331507
	and they blocked these diversion tunnels off in this area through here 331507_334400
	(..) &=in closed these gates up here 334400_336328
	&=in now this yellow part is forever under water . 336328_339126
*BEN:	&=in Underneath that lake out there 339126_340500
	and completely useless . 340500_341699
*BEN:	&=in But they did incorporate 341699_343281
	into the design of the dam 343281_344791
	&=in the balance of those diversion tunnels 344791_346950
	(.) &=in using these outer two as spillway tunnels . 346950_349996
*BEN:	&=in Now these spillways were built 349996_351582
	so that the top of the spi:llway 351582_353106
	&=in is twenty-seven feet lower than the top of the dam . 353106_356066
*BEN:	(.) &=in This assures us that n- any excess water coming down the Colorado River 356066_360121
	&=in rather than overtopping the dam 360121_362260
	&=in overtops these spillways on either side 362260_364772
	&=in goes into the canyon wall 364772_366261
	around the dam 366261_367225
	&=in out in the river down below . 367225_368850
*BEN:	(.) &=in Each one of these spillways is capable of handling &=in two hundred th:ousand cubic feet per second of water . 368850_374900
*BEN:	(.) &=in That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls . 374900_377856
*BEN:	(.) &=in &{l=X Falls &}l=X three times higher than Niagara Falls does 377856_380358
	&=in time that water reaches this area down in here 380358_382653
	&=in it is flowing at between one hundred 382653_384709
	&=in and one hundred and twenty miles an hour . 384709_386764
*BEN:	(..) &=in Okay we have protected the spillways 386764_389016
	&=in now they had to get some water 389016_390548
	(.) &=in Ê”uh- into the power plant . 390548_392095
*BEN:	(..) What they did is they built four intake towers . 392095_394626
*BEN:	&=in Two on either side of the &=in river 394626_396714
	on ledges above the river 396714_398037
	&=in each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake 398037_400754
	(..) are three hundred and ninety-five feet high . 400754_403271
*BEN:	(..) Each with two-eleven-by-thirty-two-foot gates in them 403271_406446
	&=in one gate near the bottom 406446_407703
	one about half way up 407703_408784
	&=in to let the water in . 408784_410212
*BEN:	&=in The water then coming into the penstocks 410212_412273
	&=in like the one we're standing over right now . 412273_414182
*BEN:	(..) &=in This penstock 414182_415438
	you can see on either side of us out here 415438_417204
	&=in is three stories high 417204_418468
	or thirty feet in diameter 418468_419879
	made of two-and-three-quarter-inch steel boilerplate . 419879_422963
*BEN:	(.) &=in Made in section twenty-two feet long . 422963_425360
*BEN:	(.) Each section weighing approximately &=in a hundred and fifty tons . 425360_429277
*BEN:	&=in Each of these twenty-two-foot sections is joined to the next section 429277_432248
	&=in using pressure pins like thi:s . 432248_434021
*BEN:	(.) &=in The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon 434021_436874
	&=in approximately two hundred and thirty-four pounds per square inch . 436874_440220
*BEN:	(..) &=in Okay we have the water this far 440220_442000
	now we divert that into thirteen-foot penstocks or water pipes 442000_445162
	&=in each one of em going to a turbine . 445162_446814
*BEN:	(..) &=in The force of the water turns the turbine 446814_449295
	which turns the rotor in the generator 449295_451099
	&=in and generates power . 451099_452411
*BEN:	(..) The water then coming on the tailrace 452411_454564
	we saw it up there 454564_455530
	&=in and going on downstream to be used at least (.) six more times 455530_458911
	before it reaches the Mexican border 458911_460589
	&=in to generate more power . 460589_461963
*BEN:	(.) &=in Good clean (.) reusable non-polluting source of energy . 461963_465736
*BEN:	(..) &=tsk &=in The cost of the project . 465736_468306
*BEN:	(..) A hundred and seventy-five million dollars . 468306_470889
*BEN:	(..) I say project 470889_472143
	because that includes the building of the dam 472143_474060
	&=in the building of Boulder City about seven miles up the road 474060_476854
	&=in the highway and the railway from Las Vegas out here to the dam site 476854_480302
	&=in and in southern California they built the All-American Canal 480302_483399
	&=in which takes water to the people and the crops 483399_485842
	(.) of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys . 485842_487935
*BEN:	&=in This money was borrowed on a fifty-year term at three-percent interest 487935_491323
	&=in and was paid off in fu:ll in nineteen eighty-seven . 491323_494174
*BEN:	(..) The people who worked here 494174_496063
	and they did work twenty-four hours a day 496063_497806
	&=in average twenty-four-hour work force was about thirty-five hundred men . 497806_501208
*BEN:	(.) &=in The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete 501208_504748
	&=in fourty-three hundred men . 504748_506385
*BEN:	(..) &=in The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour . 506385_509793
*BEN:	(.) &=in Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator 509793_513058
	&=in at a dollar and a qu:arter an hour . 513058_515007
*BEN:	(..) &=in Out of each man's paycheck 515007_516603
	the contractor did deduct each day 516603_518832
	&=in a dollar and sixty cents . 518832_520771
*BEN:	&=in Because the contractor was feeding 520771_522825
	&=in and housing the men in Boulder City 522825_524877
	&=in and taking them back and forth out here to the job site . 524877_527524
*BEN:	(..) They did have ninety-six (.) industrial deaths . 527524_531020
*BEN:	(.) The biggest single category of death was classified as falling material . 531020_534561
*BEN:	&=in Basically falling rock . 534561_536187
*BEN:	(..) But they did have some killed by explosion 536187_538607
	&=in some by drowning 538607_539777
	some by electrocution 539777_540995
	&=in and other types of accidents you might expect to have . 540995_543769
*BEN:	&=in On a job of this magnitude . 543769_545348
*BEN:	(..) They did complete the project 545348_547457
	two years ahead of schedule 547457_548651
	and under budget . 548651_549663
*BEN:	&=in Started in early nineteen thirty-one 549663_551606
	&=in completed in late nineteen thirty-five . 551606_553783
*BEN:	&=in Just twelve days short (.) of five years . 553783_556139
*BEN:	(..) &=in Do I have any questions . 556139_558082
*AUD:	(..) What's this overhead pipe here X . 558082_560585
*BEN:	&=in The overhead pipe . 560585_561630
*BEN:	&=in That's the fresh air pipe . 561630_562837
*BEN:	(.) &=in (..) In the summerti:me 562837_564928
	&=in the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees . 564928_567904
*BEN:	&=in So they bring that fresh air i:n 567904_569449
	&=in and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam 569449_572377
	&=in the water in that sump is a constant fifty-three degrees . 572377_575148
*BEN:	&=in It cools that air down to between sixty-eight and seventy-two degrees 575148_578530
	&=in then they force it back throughout the dam . 578530_580516
*BEN:	&=in So it's Ê”air-conditioning without refrigeration . 580516_582699
*BEN:	Like a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler . 582699_584650
*BEN:	(..) Any other questions . 584650_586590
*BEN:	(..) Yes . 586590_587344
*AUD:	(..) U:h 587344_588612
	during the uh (..) earthquake this morning 588612_591056
	do you have any sensors down here 591056_592275
	that (.) measure any kind of movement 592275_594004
	o:f (..) strâŒˆucturâŒ‰:es . 594004_595885

*BEN:	(..) Yes . 595885_596524
*BEN:	(.) W- v- we have several things . 596524_597836
*BEN:	(.) First place we have three seismographs throughout the dam . 597836_600112
*BEN:	&=in We recorded those 600112_601070
	but nobody down here felt em . 601070_602219
*BEN:	&=in But we do have sensors 602219_603664
	built right into the concrete 603664_604786
	&=in any movement that concrete makes 604786_606431
	(.) is measured and recorded . 606431_607860
*BEN:	(..) And they had very little of it this morning . 607860_609850
*BEN:	Very little . 609850_610593
*BEN:	(..) Any other questions . 610593_612879
*AUD:	(..) How far are you sending electricity . 612879_614699
*AUD:	California ? 614699_615337
