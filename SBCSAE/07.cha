*MARY:	That's right . 141330_142180
*MARY:	(..) That's right . 142180_145130

	too 170330_170830
	(..) in self assertiveness . 170830_172780
*ALIC:	Yep . 172780_173130
*MARY:	(..) you know and 173130_175730

*ALIC:	(..) &{l=X And if &}l=X something bothers you 195330_197830
	you go and you 197830_198680
