	(..) a white man 75600_76735
	who had been adopted into a tribe in Michigan . 76735_79180

*CYNT:	(..) And he gave me permission to tell the story . 88318_90684
*CYNT:	(..) &=in Long ago 90684_93667
	(..) in the sky there was only the su:n and the moo:n . 93667_97864
*CYNT:	(..) &=in And on the nights 97864_100052

	it was very dark . 101670_103100
*CYNT:	Indeed . 103100_103776
*CYNT:	(..) &=in Well all of the animals got together 103776_107202

*CYNT:	(..) Well 112293_113932
	when they arrived 113932_114682
	the creator said 114682_115732
	(..) I will help you 115732_117217
	but first you: must do something . 117217_119217
