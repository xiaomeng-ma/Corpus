@Comment:	Face-to-face conversation, recorded in a family home near
	Beloit, Wisconsin on Christmas Eve. Cam and Fred are a couple in
	their early thirties. Jo and Wess are Cam's parents. Topics include
	talk about family and friends, a football game which Wess and Fred
	had just finished watching, and holiday baking.
