@Comment:	This is a conversation recorded in
	rural Hardin, Montana. Mae Lynne is a student of equine science, and
	is the main speaker. She is telling Lenore (a visitor and near
	stranger) about her studies. Doris, Mae Lynne's mother, is doing
	housework, but joins the conversation near the end to discuss
	friends of their family.
